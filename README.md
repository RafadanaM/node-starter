# Node Typescript Starter
Barebone node typescript starter so I don't have to configure typescript again (it's a pain).

it uses:
- Node v20 (lts)
- pnpm (I want to try pnpm)
- typescript (obviously)

## Downloading the project
- Clone the project
- Make sure pnpm is installed

## Installing the Project
- `pnpm install` (use --production for production deps)

## Running the Project
- `pnpm run dev`

## Building the Project
- `pnpm build`
- `pnpm start`

## Docker Usage
- dev -> `docker compose -f docker-compose-dev.yaml up`
- prod -> `docker compose -f docker-compose-dev.prod up`
